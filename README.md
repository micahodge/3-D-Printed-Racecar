<h1>3-D Printed Racecar</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This was a project me and 2 other classmates did in our Intro to Engineering class. For this project, we 3-D printed the body, wheels, axles, and gears. One of my teammates was already good at SolidWorks, so I learned as much as I could from him while we worked together to come up with a good design for the car. In the end, all of the teams (about 30+) raced their cars to see which one was the fastest. The rules were that it had to go 40 feet, it would not cross the boundaries on each side of the path (about 3 feet on each side), and we all had 2 attempts to get the best time. We placed around 6th of the 30+ teams with a time of 7.9 seconds for 40 feet, which I am very proud of. I was very happy with the result because we were one of the fastest teams that not only had a fast car, but also had a cool design to it. Most of the teams that beat us had barebones designs, which made them super light, which meant they would go faster. So considering that, I was very happy with the result we got.<br><br>
While I did not do all of the 3-D modeling, I did most of the 3-D printing. At the beginning of the project, I did not know anything about how to print, but I learned very quickly, and I became the main person on the team to go to if something needed to be printed. Because of that, I became very familiar with the Prusa Slicer and QIDI Slicing software. The main skill I learned from this project was 3-D printing.

<h2> Software, Parts, and Materials Used</h2>

- <b>SolidWorks</b> 
- <b>Prusa Slicer</b>
- <b>Small DC Motor</b>
- <b>2-pack AA Battery Pack</b>
- <b>PLA</b>

<h2>Challenges and Solutions </h2>

- <b>The main challenge we had in the project was the weight of the car. In the end, we had a total of 5 designs that we had come up with, and we raced the 5th design, because our previous 4 attempts were too heavy. The project in the class only allowed us to use that motor as a source of speed. The motor did not have that much torque, and if we also wanted to have the car to have speed, then the only solution was to lower the weight. So, after many failed attempts at new designs with new print settings, we finally landed on a design that was light enough, could function properly, and looked cool.</b>
